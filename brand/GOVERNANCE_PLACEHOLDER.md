# Governance: foundation vs. company (placeholder)

**Status:** To be defined.

**Purpose:** Open source and long-term credibility require clear governance. This document will define the structure that separates:

- **Protocol stewardship** — Specification, verification standards, and trust layer. Best held in a neutral, durable structure (e.g. foundation).
- **Commercial operation** — Hosted infrastructure, Praxis Market, Settlement, enterprise products. Operated by the company.

**Principles (from brand strategy):**

- Core protocols and verification stay open; trust is portable.
- Monetization is on operation (hosting, marketplace, settlement, compliance), not on the right to verify or to use the standard.
- The standard should outlive any single company. Governance should reflect that.

**Next steps:**

1. Choose legal form (e.g. 501(c)(6), Swiss association, Stiftung, or similar).  
2. Define scope: what lives in foundation (specs, reference impl, certification) vs. company (Praxis Cloud, Market, Settlement as product).  
3. Draft charter, membership or oversight, and IP/licensing (e.g. Apache 2.0 for reference implementation, specification under open license).  
4. Publish and link from main site and manifesto.
