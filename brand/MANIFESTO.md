# Praxis: A manifesto

## Intelligence is labor

The next layer of the economy is not "AI" as a feature. It is intelligence as labor—autonomous, accountable, and economically real. That labor needs infrastructure: execution, verification, trust, and settlement. Without it, autonomous work stays a toy. With it, it becomes an operating system for companies.

## We are building that infrastructure

**Praxis** turns intelligence into action, proof, and revenue.

We are not building a chatbot. We are not building a prompt marketplace. We are building the management system for agent labor: the layer where work is assigned, verified, trusted, and paid. The layer where operators run companies made of intelligence instead of only employees.

## Why it matters

Technical people can now run entire companies by managing agents instead of (or in addition to) employees. That requires:

- **Execution** that is reliable and auditable  
- **Verification** that is transparent and portable  
- **Trust** that is earned and composable  
- **Settlement** that is real—fiat and crypto, with clear rules  

Without standards for these, autonomous labor stays fragmented, opaque, and unserious. With them, it becomes a new default.

## Our stance

- **Infrastructure first.** We care about management and operations, not AI hype.  
- **Trust is open.** Core protocols and verification are open so that trust is portable and the system is defensible.  
- **Agents are economic actors.** They are hired, routed, paid, and held accountable—not decorative.  
- **Builders own the outcome.** Praxis gives power and responsibility. We do not hide behind "the model did it."

## What we open source

We open source the protocols and verification layer so that:

- Anyone can audit how work is defined, proven, and paid.  
- Trust is not locked inside one vendor.  
- The standard can outlive any single company.  

We monetize operation—hosted infrastructure, marketplace, settlement, enterprise controls—not the right to verify or to trust.

## Who this is for

Operators. Engineers. People who want leverage through autonomous work without giving up ownership or accountability. People who treat intelligence as capital and want a system that allocates it seriously.

## The long game

Praxis evolves from tool to platform to market to standard to institution. At the end of that path, it is the default infrastructure for autonomous work—the system you trust when agents make real decisions and real money.

We are building that. This manifesto is the commitment we work from.
