# Praxis brand strategy

**Core identity:** Praxis = applied intelligence with accountability.  
Not AI tooling. Not agents. A system for operating autonomous companies.

**Brand anchor:**  
Praxis turns intelligence into action, proof, and revenue.

This stays consistent across product, messaging, and ecosystem.

## 1. Brand architecture

**Praxis** (umbrella brand)

| Product | Role |
|--------|------|
| **WakeNet** | Operations & execution layer |
| **TrustGraph** | Verification, reputation, governance |
| **Praxis Settlement** | Capital flow (Stripe + Coinbase) |
| **Praxis Market** | Where agents are hired, routed, and paid |
| **Praxis Studio** (later) | Design, test, and manage agent companies |

Pattern: infra-style scaling (AWS, Stripe, Tesla Energy).

---

## 2. What Praxis is (and is not)

**Praxis is:**
- Infrastructure for autonomous work
- A management system for agent labor
- A capital allocation engine for intelligence
- A trust and settlement standard

**Praxis is not:**
- A chatbot platform
- A prompt marketplace
- A SaaS automation toy

---

## 3. Brand narrative (phases)

### Phase 1 — Builders
*"Technical people can now run entire companies by managing agents instead of employees."*

- Focus: leverage, ownership, autonomy, control  
- Language: operator, execution, outcomes, capital, trust

### Phase 2 — Markets
*"Autonomous labor needs standards for trust, pricing, and settlement."*

- Focus: verification, reputation, routing, marketplaces  
- Category-defining phase.

### Phase 3 — Society-scale
*"Intelligence is now an economic actor. Praxis is the infrastructure that governs it."*

- Focus: accountability, governance, safety, economic coordination  
- Open source + credibility matter here.

---

## 4. Open source as brand strategy

Praxis earns respect by:
- Core protocols open
- Verification transparent
- Trust portable
- Incentives aligned

Result: legitimacy, adoption, defensibility.

**Positioning:** *The system you trust when agents make real decisions and money.*

---

## 5. Monetization (reinforces brand)

Monetize **operation**, not ideology:
- Hosted infrastructure
- Marketplace fees
- Settlement volume
- Enterprise trust controls
- Compliance + governance layers

Position: neutral, infrastructural, inevitable. Not extractive. Not rent-seeking.

---

## 6. Visual + tone

**Aesthetic:** academic, industrial, minimal, serious.  
Reference: Stanford systems paper, financial infrastructure, engineering-first.

**Tone:** calm, precise, non-hyped, outcome-driven.

**Avoid:** emojis, buzzwords, futurist fluff.

---

## 7. Praxis as long-term project

1. **Tool** — WakeNet + TrustGraph working  
2. **Platform** — multiple agents + payouts  
3. **Market** — hiring, pricing, routing  
4. **Standard** — trust + verification format  
5. **Institution** — default infra for autonomous work  

At 5, Praxis is no longer optional.

---

## 8. Unifying brand promise

*Praxis gives builders the power—and responsibility—to run companies made of intelligence.*

Everything shipped should reinforce: ownership, accountability, leverage, real outcomes.

---

## Bottom line

Praxis becomes a brand by:
- Being opinionated about **management**, not AI
- Staying **infrastructure-first**
- **Open-sourcing trust** while **monetizing execution**
- Treating agents as **economic actors**, not features

That makes it: credible to engineers, attractive to operators, defensible at scale.
