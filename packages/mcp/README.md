# Capnet MCP (optional)

Unified MCP gateway for WakeNet, TrustGraph, Settlement. Single MCP server exposing tools for all Capnet services so agents need one connection.

Optional: agents can also talk to per-service MCP servers or use the SDK directly. Copy `.env.example` when running the gateway.
